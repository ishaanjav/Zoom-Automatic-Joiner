# Zoom Automatic Joiner

The Zoom Automatic Joiner is a tool that automatically handles joining Zoom meetings for you.
All you have to do is run the tool and it will wait until your next Zoom meeting starts and open it up by itself!

You just have to do a one-time setup in [`setup.py`](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Zoom-Automatic-Joiner/blob/main/setup.py) and provide the Zoom links and the times you want to join them.

## Setup
Download the repository. Go to [`setup.py`](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Zoom-Automatic-Joiner/blob/main/setup.py) and enter in the list of Zoom links and join times.

## Usage
**Open Terminal, type `zoom`, hit enter, and do other things as the tool joins the meeting for you whenever it starts!**

### More details
1. You can run the `zoom.py` Python file by typing `python3 zoom.py` into the command line
2. **OR** you can copy and paste [`script.sh`](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Zoom-Automatic-Joiner/blob/main/script.sh) into your `bash_profile` or `bash_src` for one-time setup. Now, regardless of which directory you are in, all you have to type in Terminal is `zoom` and it runs the tool for you.
